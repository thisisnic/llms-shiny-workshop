### Workshop Overview

Large language models (LLMs) are transforming how we work, but using them effectively‚Äîespecially within the R ecosystem‚Äîrequires careful design and deployment. The {ellmer} package simplifies access to LLMs in R, making it easier to build AI-powered applications, automate workflows, and extract structured insights from unstructured data. But how do you move from experimentation to real-world deployment?

This hands-on workshop will guide you through practical applications of LLMs in R, using {ellmer} to integrate AI capabilities into Shiny apps. We‚Äôll cover:

* prompt design and engineering
* the {ellmer} R package
* creating LLM-powered Shiny apps
* deploying LLM-powered Shiny apps

Throughout the session, we'll balance hands-on coding with discussion of best practices for deploying LLM-powered automation responsibly. Whether you're an R developer exploring AI for the first time or looking to integrate LLMs into business workflows, this workshop will equip you with the tools and techniques to deploy AI-powered solutions confidently.

Participants should have basic familiarity with R and some experience working with Shiny apps. Code examples and exercises will be provided to reinforce key concepts.  Information will be provided ahead of the workshop about packages to install and any other technical prerequisites.


*This course is for you if you:*

-   want to learn how to work with tabular data that is too large to fit in memory using existing R and tidyverse syntax implemented in Arrow
-   want to learn about Parquet and other file formats that are powerful alternatives to CSV files
-   want to learn how to engineer your tabular data storage for more performant access and analysis with Apache Arrow

### Workshop Prework

All participants need to bring is a laptop that can connect to wifi. We will be using Posit Workbench to learn together---Workbench will be setup with all the software and data needed for the day. If you would prefer to run code locally on your own laptop, detailed instructions for software requirements and data sources are covered in [Packages & Data](setup.qmd).


### Workshop Schedule

*"This schedule is more what you would call a 'guideline' than an actual schedule"* --- Barbossa, Pirates of the Caribbean
