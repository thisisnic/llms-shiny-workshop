# Deploying LLM-Powered Shiny Apps {#deploy}

<!-- 30 mins teaching time maximum -->

## Learning Outcomes

Participants will:
- Understand deployment options (e.g., ShinyApps.io, Posit Connect, and self-hosted solutions) and their relative merits
- Understand how to deploy an LLM-powered Shiny app using free-tier hosting.
- Understand how to store API keys in environment variables.
- Have deployed their own app to Posit Cloud Connect

## Deployment options and relative merits

* deployment options (e.g., ShinyApps.io, Posit Connect, and self-hosted solutions) and their relative merits

## Posit Connect Cloud

* Store secrets in environment variables - NEVER hard-code them
* `rsconnct::writeManifest()` to track dependencies

## API keys as environment variables

* how to store API keys in environment variables.
* local versus in-environment deployment

## Demo: Deploying an app to Posit Connect Cloud

## Exercise
* Add environment variable to Posit Connect Cloud
* Deploy their app and test it live

## Scaling advice

* Fail fast: Always validate input before sending to LLMs.
* Secure secrets: Never commit API keys.
* No illusions: One-user testing â‰  production-ready app.
* Have a real fallback: Plan for LLM outages or rate limits.
