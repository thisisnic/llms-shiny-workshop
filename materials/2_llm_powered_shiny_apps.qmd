# Creating LLM-Powered Shiny Apps {#llmshiny}

## Learning Outcomes

Participants will understand how to:
- How to structure Shiny apps with {ellmer} components, referencing the provided template
- How to implement basic input validation to mitigate prompt injection risks
- How to get structured outputs from it
- Best practices for reactivity so not making too many requests


## Shiny app basics and where {ellmer} should be integrated 

(as app not package for simplicity)

## Storing prompts in inst and using glue-like syntax

## Input validation (and just using selectors and templating etc)

## Retrieving structured output

## Demo
- Walkthrough of the provided Shiny app skeleton:
- Review UI and server structure.
- Identify where {ellmer} should be integrated and prompts stored

## Limiting token usage via reactivity (button press) and monitoring usage 

## Preventing too many calls within short space of time (button reclick?)

## Exercise: Creating own prompt templates in the app and Adding input validation for free text fields
