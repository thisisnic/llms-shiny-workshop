The {ellmer} package simplifies access to LLMs in R, making it easier to build AI-powered applications, automate workflows, and extract structured insights from unstructured data. But how do you move from experimentation to real-world deployment?\nThis hands-on workshop will guide you through practical applications of LLMs in R, using {ellmer} to integrate AI capabilities into Shiny apps. We‚Äôll cover:\n\nprompt design and engineering\nthe {ellmer} R package\ncreating LLM-powered Shiny apps\ndeploying LLM-powered Shiny apps\n\nThroughout the session, we‚Äôll balance hands-on coding with discussion of best practices for deploying LLM-powered automation responsibly. Whether you‚Äôre an R developer exploring AI for the first time or looking to integrate LLMs into business workflows, this workshop will equip you with the tools and techniques to deploy AI-powered solutions confidently.\nParticipants should have basic familiarity with R and some experience working with Shiny apps. Code examples and exercises will be provided to reinforce key concepts. Information will be provided ahead of the workshop about packages to install and any other technical prerequisites.\n\n\nWorkshop Prework\n\nTBD\n\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n\nPart 1 - Introduction\nPart 2 - Building LLM-Powered Shiny Apps\nPart 3 - Deployment\n\n\n\nInstructors\nNic Crane is an R consultant with a background in data science and software engineering. They are passionate about open source, and learning and teaching all things R. Nic is part of the core team that maintain the Arrow R package, and a co-author of ‚ÄúScaling up with R and Arrow‚Äù, due to be published by CRC Press later this year.\n\n This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License."
